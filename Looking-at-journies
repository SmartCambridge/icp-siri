Looking at journies
===================

Start with

create table journies as (select distinct vehiclemonitoringref, lineref, directionref, dataframeref, datedvehiclejourneyref, operatorref, originref, destinationref, originaimeddeparturetime from activity);

Show that 

select distinct dataframeref from journies;

only returns 1 so dataframeref is irrelavent.

select count(*), datedvehiclejourneyref from journies group by datedvehiclejourneyref order by datedvehiclejourneyref asc;

confirms that lower datedvehiclejourneyref appear more frequently (2 most frequently at 69 times)

For 2017-04-26, the combination (datedvehiclejourneyref, vehiclemonitoringref, lineref) appears unique.
